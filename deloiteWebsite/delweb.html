                <h1>What is CAA?</h1>
            <blockquote>
                The legislation applies to those who were “forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on
                 the ground of religion”. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration. The cut-off date 
                 for citizenship is December 31, 2014 which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date.
                  Indian citizenship, under present law, is given either to those born in India or if they have resided in the country 
                  for a minimum of 11 years.
